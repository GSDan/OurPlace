  <string name="loginInfo_whyTitle">Why do I need to log into OurPlace through another service?</string>
  <string name="loginInfo_whyAnswer">OurPlace uses other social media services to authenticate user accounts through a secure process called OAuth. This lets our users create and sign into accounts, without needing to think up and remember yet another password. It also means you don\'t have to trust us with keeping any passwords safe - we never receive one! You just sign in with a service you likely already have an account for. This makes things easier and more secure for both of us.</string>
  <string name="loginInfo_whatTitle">What information does OurPlace take from these services?</string>
  <string name="loginInfo_whatAnswer">We take the minimum amount of information from your social media account in order to provide a good service. We don\'t have access to your friends lists, and we can\'t and won\'t post things on your behalf. We simply store your name, date of birth, a link to your profile picture and your email address.</string>
  <string name="loginInfo_howTitle">Why do you need this information and how will it be used?</string>
  <string name="loginInfo_howAnswer">We need an email address to be able to identify you across services. If, for example, you signed into OurPlace with a Google account and then the next week signed in using Facebook, we could see that you\'re the same person thanks to the matching email address. We will not share any of your details with third parties and we will not spam your email account. The other basic profile information is used to personalise your OurPlace experience and help us keep track of how the service is being used.</string>
